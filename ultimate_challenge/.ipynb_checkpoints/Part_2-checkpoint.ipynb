    "The best metric would be the activity levels in each of the city, particularly those during the weekdays. In most cases, city managers would want to pursue such an experiment to help boost GDP and revenue. For simplicity, let's assume that city activity and GDP have a strong positive correlation to each other. The mark to beat would be whether or not the positive change in activity in both cities is greater than that generated by the tolls on the bridge. By reimbursing all toll costs, the tolls would no longer generate any revenue. Thus, if the GDP increase in both cities from the experiment is greater than the revenue lost from the elimination of the tolls, then the experiment can be considered a success."

    "Depending on how urgent the cities are on boosting activity, designate a period of time, let's say 3 months, where all toll costs will be reimbursed. Each city will then over the next 3 month period monitor the daily activity of their own cities, with particular emphasis during the weekdays. Once the experimental phase is over (after 3 months), the cities will then organize all the data gathered and compare them against a similar timeframe under normal circumstances when the toll is in effect."
